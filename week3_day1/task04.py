Task 04 · Update, Delete & Data Integrity [Hard]

Databases aren't just for storing — managing and maintaining data is equally important

Goal
Build a student grade management system — insert, update, delete, and validate data.

Create grades.db with a students table: id, name, subject, score, grade TEXT
Insert 15 students with various scores (mix them between 40-100)
Write a function assign_grade(score) that returns A/B/C/D/F based on score
UPDATE all rows — set the grade column using your function
DELETE all students who scored below 50 — they didn't pass
Add a new column passed BOOLEAN using ALTER TABLE — set it based on score >= 50
Query: show count of students per grade, ordered from A to F
Handle the case where a student name is entered twice — check before inserting
