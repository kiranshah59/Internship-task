Task 01 · Create, Insert & Query [Medium]
Independent task — build your first MySQL database from scratch
Goal:
Create a MySQL database, populate it with data, and run queries to answer questions about it.
1. Create a database called library.db with a table books
   (id, title, author, year, genre, rating REAL)
2. Insert at least 8 books — use a mix of genres, years, and ratings
3. Query 1:
   SELECT all books published after 2000, ordered by rating (highest first)
4. Query 2:
   SELECT all books in the 'Fiction' genre with rating above 4.0
5. Query 3:
   Find the average rating across all books
6. Query 4:
   Count how many books exist per genre — use GROUP BY genre
7. Print all query results neatly with labels — not just raw tuples

Bonus : Add a reviews table and link it to books via book_id foreign key
Deliverable: library.db + script showing all 4 query outputs
